        <title>Mapping the 19th Century City Project</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;mapping-the-19th-century-city-project&quot;&gt;Mapping the 19th Century City Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester, for Mapping the 19th Century City with &lt;a href=&quot;http://gtritchroman.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gretta Tritch Roman&lt;/a&gt;, 
I’m working on a mapping project. Initially, I wanted to map sentiments surrounding immigrants in 19th century New York City. 
After much trial and error, I wrote some Python code to do that for me, through sentiment analysis on the keyword “immigrant” 
in context among 4 major 1860 New York City newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here was the result of that endeavor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://plot.ly/~ns2349/2.embed&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this does not function very well as a map. I decided to try mapping the towns in New York which were mentioned
in these texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I was able to create:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://ns2349.carto.com/viz/4556c7aa-f5ce-11e5-ae95-0ef24382571b/embed_map&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That didn’t seem as fruitful as I’d hoped, so I tried mapping the mentions of nationalities in the newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is the destination to which I was led by that inquiry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://ns2349.carto.com/viz/53f3330a-204b-11e6-87b7-0ecfd53eb7d3/embed_map&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all for now!&lt;/p&gt;
