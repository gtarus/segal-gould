## About this site

[This site](http://segal-gould.com) has undergone many changes and several iterations.
For a few years it was hosted through [Beastnode](https://www.beastnode.com/) which
I only chose because I used to use their [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en/) hosting
services. There used to be a [Wordpress blog](https://wordpress.org/) as well. After much
deliberation and many dollars spent on Virtual Private Servers, I've decided to make the
switch to [GitHub](https://github.com/). Static site generation through [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
seems like the best, cheapest, and cleanest alternative to all I've tried before.
I hope it works well for you.

This site contains information pertaining mostly to Noah Segal-Gould's:

- [Projects](http://segal-gould.com/projects/)
- [Blog](http://segal-gould.com/articles/)
- [R&eacute;sum&eacute;](segal-gould.com/resume/)
