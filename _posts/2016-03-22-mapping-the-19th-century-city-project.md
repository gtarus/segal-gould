## Mapping the 19th Century City Project

This semester, for Mapping the 19th Century City withÂ <a href="http://gtritchroman.com/" target="_blank">Gretta Tritch Roman</a>, 
I'm working on a mapping project. Initially, I wanted to map sentiments surrounding immigrants in 19th century New York City. 
After much trial and error, I wrote some Python code to do that for me, through sentiment analysis on the keyword "immigrant" 
in context among 4 major 1860 New York City newspapers.

Here was the result of that endeavor:

Unfortunately, this does not function very well as a map. I decided to try mapping the towns in New York which were mentioned
in these texts.

This is what I was able to create:

<iframe width='100%' height='400' frameborder='0' src='https://ns2349.carto.com/viz/4556c7aa-f5ce-11e5-ae95-0ef24382571b/embed_map' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>

That didn't seem as fruitful as I'd hoped, so I tried mapping the mentions of nationalities in the newspapers.

The following is the destination to which I was led by that inquiry:

That's all for now!
