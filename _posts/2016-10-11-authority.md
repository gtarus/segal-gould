"I am not an expert."
and
"Do not take what I say as fact."

These are the disclaimers I would like to place at the top of every paper, report, file, and program I have ever written.

I'm not sure why, but that disclaimer feels absolutely essential in order to achieve the opposite of what most of those who produce content seem to want:

Authority.

In a world of constant claims to authority and desperate attempts to prove the worth of what one says, I don't just lack the confidence to do what everyone else does. I also lack the desire.

Authority does not appeal to me. It's superficial and pointlessly unobtainable: all who claim to possess it can surely be challenged. If authority is not permanent, is it any kind of authority at all?

I don't know.
